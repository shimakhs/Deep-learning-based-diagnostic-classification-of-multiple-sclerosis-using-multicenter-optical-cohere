# OCT Thickness Map Inpainting Analysis

This repository provides a reproducible pipeline for preprocessing, inpainting, and quantitative analysis of retinal OCT thickness maps, with a focus on layer-wise correction and spatial characterization of inpainted regions.

The method is designed for multi-layer retinal thickness representations derived from OCT boundary maps and is particularly suitable for neuro-ophthalmological studies such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

##  Overview

Retinal OCT thickness maps may contain localized artifacts or abrupt variations due to segmentation errors, noise, or acquisition inconsistencies.  
This project applies an **adaptive, data-driven inpainting strategy** to correct such regions while preserving physiologically meaningful structures.

The pipeline includes:
- Boundary-map preprocessing
- Inter-layer thickness computation
- Channel-wise normalization
- Adaptive inpainting using high-frequency detection
- Quantitative comparison before and after inpainting
- Spatial frequency analysis of corrected regions
- Group-wise analysis (Healthy Controls vs MS)

##  Key Features

- Adaptive inpainting on **floating-point thickness maps**
- High-pass residual–based anomaly detection
- Layer-wise processing (RNFL, GCIPL, INL)
- Spatial frequency maps of inpainted regions
- Fully modular and reproducible code
- Publication-ready visualization outputs
